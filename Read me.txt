Hi Nick.

First thing you want to do is Ctrl + R, type cmd ###opens command prompt###
Then type: 'pip install nltk' ###packages which contain modules needed to run April, like certain modules that don't already come with python###
Then type: 'pip3 torch torchvision torch audio' ###same as above reason.###

Once they have been installed run 'chat'. and enjoy :-)
